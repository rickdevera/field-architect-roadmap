## 2026 Field Architect & Technical Community Roadmap

---

## Overview

This roadmap outlines my 2026 focus areas across AI, cloud security, and technical enablement.

The objective is simple:

- Stay hands-on with modern cloud and AI technologies  
- Publish practical, lab-backed insights  
- Contribute consistently to practitioner communities  
- Build structured enablement that teams can actually use  

This is not a marketing initiative.  
It is a long-term technical commitment.

---

## Vision

To contribute meaningfully to the cloud and AI community by:

- Translating architecture into executable labs  
- Sharing field-tested implementation patterns  
- Supporting practitioner voices  
- Promoting disciplined, governance-driven adoption of emerging technologies  

---

## Guiding Principles

**Build What You Teach**  
All published insights are validated in a working lab environment.

**Enable Execution**  
Content should help engineers and architects implement—not just understand.

**Governance Matters**  
Adoption without structure leads to long-term failure.

**Consistency Over Hype**  
Authority is built through steady contribution.

**Hands-On First**  
Remaining technically current is non-negotiable.

## 6-Month Objectives

### 1. Establish a Clear Technical Voice

- Publish weekly 5-minute architecture insights  
- Maintain short-form technical clips  
- Share structured reflections on cloud and AI adoption  
- Develop a consistent format and delivery style  

---

### 2. Release Flagship Enablement Labs

Publish at least one fully structured workshop:

- AI governance lab (AWS-focused)  
- CNAPP + cloud integration blueprint  
- Architecture comparison lab (e.g., service tradeoffs)  

Each lab will include:

- Architecture diagram  
- Implementation walkthrough  
- GitHub documentation  
- Short-form explainer video  
- Strategic write-up outlining tradeoffs  

---

### 3. Launch “Field Architect Notes” Series

A focused series exploring:

- Practical AI governance models  
- Designing technical enablement  
- Cloud security integration patterns  
- Bridging field execution with leadership expectations  

Format:

- Short video insights  
- Written architectural notes  
- Supporting lab documentation where relevant  

---

### 4. Community Engagement

- Host at least one live technical workshop (virtual)  
- Participate in practitioner discussions  
- Build relationships within cloud and AI communities  

The goal is contribution, not audience growth.

---

## Publishing Rhythm 

Weekly:
- 1 focused architecture insight (≤ 5 minutes)
- 2 short-form clips
- 1 structured LinkedIn post

Monthly:
- 1 in-depth architectural essay
- 1 lab enhancement or release

Quarterly:
- 1 flagship workshop or structured release

---

## Technical Lab Environment

Maintain a personal lab environment to:

- Test emerging cloud and AI tooling  
- Validate governance patterns  
- Build reproducible workshop artifacts  
- Evaluate architecture tradeoffs  

Hands-on validation remains the foundation of all published work.

---

## Long-Term Direction

This roadmap supports continued development toward:

- Field-facing technical leadership  
- Workshop-first enablement strategy  
- Community contribution grounded in execution  
- Practical cloud and AI architecture  

Progress will be iterative and visible.

## Status

This roadmap is active as of 2026.  
Updates and refinements will be reflected in commit history.
